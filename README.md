# UBC-EL-Python
This repository includes my Final Project, for "Programming in Python for Data Science" course in the UBC Extended Learning - Key Capabilities for Data Science program, in both HTML and Jupyter Notebook versions.  

## Project Summary
In this project, I was given two data sets, *disney_movies_total_gross.csv*, which includes relevant information about theatrical releases from Disney in the past, and *disney-director.csv*, which lists the director of all associated movie productions. I was then tasked with devising my own questions surrounding these two data sets, and constructing my own data analysis through Python's coding language via Jupyter Notebook; my questions were mostly centered around **the strongest financial performers in different categories, such as which year/genre/director achieved the highest box office results.** In addition to making adequate adjustments and wrangling to the dataframes, I have also compiled numerous bar charts to better visualize the information and communicate my findings.  

For a more in-depth look at my project, please download and open the HTML or Jupyter Notebook file (HTML might be easier should you not have Anaconda/Jupyter Notebook installed).
